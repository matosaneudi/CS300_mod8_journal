What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
   In the projects for this course the problems i was solving was choosing the "best" data stucture for the course schedlue planer and evaluating the run times. The word document has the different data structures that were considired and their pseudocode along with the evaluated runtimes. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
   I approached the problem by evaluating the pseudocode and the problem that i needed to solve, with the small dataset that was being going to be used I decided that using vectors was the best approach. Data structures are important to understand because knowing the right one to use can save a lot of time and can result in having a better final product. This is because the program may run better and safer if data is being handled efficiently. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
   When I encountered roadblocks in this course I used my resources to help me understand what i needed to do, those resources were zyBooks, stack overflow, youtube and even geeksforgeeks. Using these resources I learned how to write the data structures for this course. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
