What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
   In the projects for this course the problems i was solving was choosing the "best" data stucture for the course schedlue planer and evaluating the run times. The word document has the different data structures that were considired and their pseudocode along with the evaluated runtimes. The program made had to do four functions from the menu 1. Load the courses from a csv file 2. print a sample schedule 3. search for a couurse 4. exit. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
   I approached the problem by evaluating the pseudocode of the data structures and the problem that I needed to solve, with the small dataset that was going to be used I decided that using vectors was the best approach. Data structures are important to understand because knowing the right one to use can save a lot of time and can result in having a better final product. This is because the program may run better and safer if data is being handled efficiently. At the time that I made my decision if i had understood the data structures better I would have chose HashTables.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
   When I encountered roadblocks in this course I used my resources to help me understand what i needed to do, those resources were zyBooks, stack overflow, youtube and even geeksforgeeks. Using these resources I learned how to write the data structures for this course. One of the roadblocks I encountered was that Vectors can only store one data type and its not particularly useful for storing things that have multiple connections. For example in this project every course had at least a courseId and courseName if i was to store both of those for every course in one vector it would be a mess. I opted for only storing the CourseId in the vector and then just finding the name to the ID. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
   This project reinforced the importance of writing detailed pseudocode, this helps when you need to look back and write the functions you made weeks earlier. This saves time and prevents you from starting all over again. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   This project required the each function to be seperate and modular. Having clean code and writing inline comments made the code easy to edit and to find bugs.
